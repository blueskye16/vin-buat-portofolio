### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kevin.

<p align="justify">An Software Engineer student who loves to create and share projects about web and data processing technology! I've enjoyed Working on website projects, about how to develop a website that more interactive and in line with user needs.</p>

Beside that, I really enjoy processing data using several tools such as SQL, spreadsheets and Tableau. I think I will never get tired of getting valuable information from data to process it into more valuable information.
